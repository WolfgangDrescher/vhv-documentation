summary: Dynamic use of the verovio javascript toolkit to update the notation display of editable Humdrum data on the page.

The page describes how to generate dynamic notation from Humdrum data
that you edit on a web pages.  The setup for the Humdrum editing box
is a bit compilicated, so this page still has to be written.

In the meantime you can observe how it is setup in the Jekyll static-site
generating system for use in the VHV documentation.  Start with the
[source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdrum-tools/vhv-documentation/gh-pages/myvhv/dynamic/index.md) for this page.  Also see the 
[source code](https://github.com/humdrum-tools/vhv-documentation/tree/master/_includes/verovio.html) for the verovio figure template, and the
[source code](https://github.com/humdrum-tools/vhv-documentation/tree/master/_includes/verovio_support_functions.html) for the JavaScript support functions.

## Example ##

Try editing the Humdrum data in the box below.  The notation should update
as you change it.

{% include verovio.html
	source="myhumdrum"
%}

<script type="text/humdrum" id="myhumdrum">
**kern
*M4/4
=1-
4c
4c
4g
4g
=2
4a
4a
2g
=3
4f
4f
4e
4e
=4
4d
4d
2c;
==
*-
</script>

Display of the Humdrum data is optional, but then the notation is not editable:



<div style="margin-top: -10px;">
{% include verovio.html
	source="myhumdrum2"
	pageWidth="1600"
	humdrum-visible="false"
%}
<script type="text/humdrum" id="myhumdrum2">
**kern
*M4/4
=1-
4c
4c
4g
4g
=2
4a
4a
2g
=3
4f
4f
4e
4e
=4
4d
4d
2c;
==
*-
</script>
</div>
