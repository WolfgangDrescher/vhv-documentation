## **vdata ##

Another text-rendering exclusive interpretation is `**vdata`,  which
converts data into verse-like text rather than chord-like text.

{% include note.html
	content="**vdata cannot be placed above the staff due to current limitations in verovio."
%}

{% include warning.html
	content ="A limitation of **vdata is that it can only be displayed if there is a note to attached to in the associated **kern data at the same time instant; otherwise, an unattached data token will not be displayed in the score."
%}

Here is an example of given a label to the spine data in the score `*v:` followed by a label will
be displayed at the start of the music, and `*vv:` labels will repeat at the start of each system.
This feature is not available for `**adata`, `**bdata` or `**cdata`.
