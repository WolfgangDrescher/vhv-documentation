## Ornaments ##

Here is a sampler of ornaments.  Upper-case ornaments indicate
whole-tone auxiliary notes, and lower-case ornaments indicate
semi-tone auxiliary notes.  If the auxiliary notes require accidentals
in the graphical music notation, then will be added automatically, as
well as cautionary accidentals that may be needed on primary notes
which follow the auxiliary notes of the ornaments.
