The humtr filter is somewhat analogous to the unix
[tr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr_(Unix)) command.  It is useful
for transforming one set of characters into another.   Various options
allow selectively targeting lyrical text, text directions, dynamic and
reference records.  The primary use it to translform archaic letters and
orthography into a more moderns style, such as converting the long s into
a plain s.
