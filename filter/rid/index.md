The rid filter is useful for removing empty lines in Humdrum data.
A primary use of the filter is in clean-up of spacer lines in the
data after a part has been extracted.


## Removing null lines ##

The options `-g`, `-l`, `-i`, and `-d` are useful for removing empty
global comments (`!!`), local comments (`!`), interpretations (`*`) and
data lines (`.`).

See the Humdrum Toolkit <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.humdrum.org/man/rid/">documentation for the rid
tool</a>, which is mostly compatible with the VHV filter implementation
of rid.

See the Humdrum Extras <a target="_blank"
href="http://extras.humdrum.org/man/ridx/">documentation for the ridx
tool</a>, which is nearly identical to the VHV filter implementation
of rid.
