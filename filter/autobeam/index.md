The autobeam filter can be used to automatically add beams to notes
according to the prevailing meter.  Here is an example where the 
autobeam filter is being applied to the music, which contains one
measure of 3/4 music and another in 6/8.

{% include verovio.html
	source="meterchange"
	scale="60"
	humdrum-min-height="365px"
	pageWidth="1450"
	tabsize="16"
%}
<script type="application/json" id="meterchange">
!!!filter: autobeam
**kern
*M3/4
8c
8e
8d
8f
8g
8e
=
*M6/8
8c
8d
8e
8g

</script>

Try deleting the filter from the above Humdrum data and see what happens.


In the VHV editor, you can also type <span class="keypress">alt-c</span>
to "compile" the filter, which will result in the beam markers being 
added to the data in the editor.  (The <span class="keypress">alt-c</span>
command will not work on this page, however).


### Selecting a particular spine ###

If only a single staff needs to be processed, then used the `-t` (track) option. 
The first track (spine) is the left-most (beginning) one in the data.  Here is an
example of beaming the second track (spine) while leaving the first one unaltered:



{% include verovio.html
	source="track"
	scale="60"
	humdrum-min-height="365px"
	pageWidth="1450"
	tabsize="16"
%}
<script type="application/json" id="track">
!!!filter: autobeam -t 2
**kern	**kern
*M3/4	*M3/4
8c	8cc
8e	8ee
8d	8dd
8f	8ff
8g	8gg
8e	8ee
=	=
*M6/8	*M6/8
8c	8cc
8d	8dd
8e	8ee
8g	8gg
8f	8ff
8e	8ee
==	==
*-	*-
</script>


### Selecting a particular staff ###

In addition to selecting by track, you can also select by staff.
Specifically by `**kern` spine number, starting with 1 as the lowest
staff (left-mote `**kern` spine in the data).  In the following data,
the last spine is the 3rd track, but the 2nd staff:



{% include verovio.html
	source="kern"
	scale="60"
	humdrum-min-height="365px"
	pageWidth="1450"
	tabsize="8"
%}
<script type="application/json" id="kern">
!!!filter: autobeam -k 2
**kern	**fing	**kern
*M3/4	*	*M3/4
8c	1	8cc
8e	3	8ee
8d	2	8dd
8f	4	8ff
8g	3	8gg
8e	5	8ee
=	=	=
*M6/8	*	*M6/8
8c	1	8cc
8d	2	8dd
8e	3	8ee
8g	5	8gg
8f	4	8ff
8e	3	8ee
==	==	==
*-	*-	*-
</script>


### Removing beams ###

Use the `-r` option to remove existing beams.  Here is an example
where the beams on the top staff are removed:


{% include verovio.html
	source="remove"
	scale="60"
	humdrum-min-height="365px"
	pageWidth="1450"
	tabsize="16"
%}
<script type="application/json" id="remove">
!!!filter: autobeam -r -k2
**kern	**kern
*M3/4	*M3/4
8cL	8ccL
8e	8ee
8d	8dd
8f	8ff
8g	8gg
8eJ	8eeJ
=	=
*M6/8	*M6/8
8cL	8ccL
8d	8dd
8e	8ee
8g	8gg
8f	8ff
8eJ	8eeJ
==	==
*-	*-
</script>


### Splitting beams by lyrics ###

The `-l` option can be used to break beams so that lyric syllables
start at the beginning of beam groups.  In the following example, the
top staff shows the original beaming, and the bottom staff show the 
beaming after being processed with the `autobeam -l` filter.  This splits
the second beat's beam into two groups: a single eighth note with `is` underneath,
and the syllable `so-` starting a new beam group of two notes from the rest
of the beat.

{% include verovio.html
	source="lyrics"
	scale="60"
	humdrum-min-height="365px"
	spacingLinear="0.65"
	pageWidth="1450"
	tabsize="16"
%}
<script type="application/json" id="lyrics">
**kern	**text
*M4/4	*
=1	=1
8.cL	This_
16dJ	.
8fL	is
16dL	so-
16eJJ	.
4d	-me
4c	text.
==	==
*-	*-
!!!filter: extract -s 1-$,1-$
!!!filter: autobeam -l -k 1
</script>


Note the filter `extract -s 1-$,1-$` which duplicates the original system
of music. Then the `-k 1` option for autobeam applies beam breaking for syllable
starts only to the first kern spine (the lowest staff in the system).
