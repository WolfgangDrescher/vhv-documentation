The `cmr` filter marks conspicuous melodic repetitions, particularly for
use with digital scores in the Josquin Research Project.

A "Conspicuous Melodic Repetition" is defined as the repetition of a pitch
at least three times within six whole notes duration.  One of the repeated
pitches must be a local maximum (or minimum) and be either syncopated 
or approached by a leap.  The other repeated notes must be at least metrically
accented.
