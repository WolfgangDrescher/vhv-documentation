## Extracting/showing only scale degree analyses ##

The `-I` option can be used to output only `**deg` spines instead
of embedding them in the input score.  This option by itself cannot
be displayed as music notation (currently, but may be implemented
in the future).

You can add the `--recip` option to output a timelines for the
`**deg` spines.   This is also not yet displayable, but you can add
`--kern` to display an invisible staff line to display in VHV.
