Pressing <span class="keypress">alt-l</span> will toggle colorization
of secondary layers in the notation.  This feature can be useful
for proof-reading music by highlighting unusual sub-spine/layer
organization in the data that is not visible in the graphical
notation, such as interchanged layers (cases where layers 1 and 2 should
be interchanged).

	alt="Coloring second layer of notes green."
	max-width="30%"
	caption="Coloring second layer of notes green."

Here is an example of using <span class="keypress">alt-l</span> on a real 
piece of music:

{% include image.html
	file="show-layers.gif"
	alt="Coloring second layer of notes green."
	max-width="100%"
	caption="Showing different layers of music."
%}
