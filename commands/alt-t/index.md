## Saving the currently displayed page

Pressing <span class="keypress">alt-t</span> will download a PDF
containing the currently displayed music in the VHV webpage.  If the
graphical music is wider than it is high, the downloaded PDF will be 
in landscape mode; otherwise, the PDF will be in portrait orientation.

Files will be downloaded wherever your browser saves downloaded files.  Here
is a demonstration of typing <span class="keypress">alt-t</span> to save
a file and then opening the downloaded PDF in another tab in the web browser.

	file="save-pdf.gif"

## Saving the entire score to a PDF file

Pressing <span class="keypress">alt-shift-T</span> will download a PDF
containing the entire score.  The layout in VHV will not be used but
rather the music will be typeset for letter-sized paper in portrait
orientation:

{% include image.html
	file="save-full-pdf.gif"
	alt="save currently viewed score."
	caption="Saving currently viewed score to a multi-page PDF."
