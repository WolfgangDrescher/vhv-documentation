For most of the online VHV [repertories](/repertory), pressing 
<span class="keypress">alt-p</span> will load a PDF
of the source edition used to create the digital score.
The PDF scan of the source edition is opened in a separate 
window and can be used proof-reading of the digital score.

For example, going to this link:

```
http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chopin/mazurkas/mazurka67-4.krn
```

displays the following digital score:

{% include image.html
	file="mazurka.png"
	alt="digital score."
	caption="Digital score and rendered notation."
%}

When pressing <span class="keypress">alt-p</span> on the
above page, the following window will be opened with a
PDF file of the source edition:


{% include image.html
	file="altp.png"
	alt="PDF scan of source score."
	caption="PDF of scanned version of source edition."
%}


The VHV editor and source print windows can be resized 
and arranged for proof-reading:

{% include image.html
	file="windows.png"
	alt="digital score and print source."
	maxwidth="100%"
	caption="Digital score window about print source window."
%}
