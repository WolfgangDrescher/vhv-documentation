The URL
[http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales](http://verovio.humdrum.org/?k=e&file=chorales)
lists a set of 371 four-part chorales that were collected after
J.S. Bach's death by his son C.P.E. Bach (and finished by Kirnberger,
a student of J.S. Bach, after C.P.E. Bach's death).  The chorales
are ordered by Breitkopf & Härtel edition numbers and includes all
chorales except #150 which is not in four parts.


The first complete edition of the chorales in this set was published
by Breitkopf & Härtel from 1784-1787 in four volumes.  The first
incomplete edition consisted of 200 chorales in two volumes by
Friedrich Wilhelm Birnstiel in 1765 & 1769, which was reprinted in
1975 by Georg Olms.

This digital edition is referenced against the
fourth edition of the chorales by Breitkopf & Härtel: *371
vierstimmige Choralgesänge von Johann Sebastian Bach*. 4th ed. by
Alfred Dörffel. Breitkopf & Härtel, Leipzig [c. 1875]. 178 pp. Plate
Number: V.A.10. Retypeset c. 1915 as Edition Breitkopf 10. Reprinted
by Associated Music Publishers, Inc., New York [c. 1940].

Scans of the source edition for the first 50 chorales can be viewed
by pressing <span class="keypress">alt-p</span> when viewing a
particular chorale:

See this
article: [The History of the Breitkopf Collection of J.S. Bach's
Four-Part Chorales](http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Articles/Breitkopf-History.htm)
by Thomas Braatz for more information about the source edition of the
Bach chorales.


## Original-clef feature ##

The Bach-chorale repertory demonstrates how to encode
[original clefs](/commands/alt-o).  Type
<span class="keypress">alt-o</span> in VHV to switch between modern and original clefs
when viewing the chorales:

{% include image.html
	file="alt-o-clef-switching.png"
	alt="alt-o demonstration"
	caption=""
%}




The first edition of this chorale collection was actually published
in grand-staff arrangement, using soprano clef for the top staff
and bass clef on the bottom staff:

{% include image.html
	file="chorale-first-edition.png"
	alt="first edition"
	caption="First edtion of the chorales in soprano and bass clefs on a grand staff."
%}

Here is an example arrangement of the music that more closely matches the original edition:

	scale="50"

## Grand-staff arrangement ##

The Same Bach chorale data can be viewed in grand-staff layout by
using this link: [verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales&filter=satb2gs](http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales&filter=satb2gs).

{% include image.html
	file="chor027-grand-staff.png"
	alt="grand-staff layout"
	url="http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor027.krn&filter=satb2gs"
	caption="Grand-staff layout of chorales using the satb2gs filter."
	caption-margin-top="-20px"
%}


## Transposed chorales ##

The Bach chorales can also be transposed all to the same tonic pitch
in grand-staff layout by
adding a transpose filter to the URL: [verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales&filter=satb2gs%7ctranspose%20-kc](http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales&filter=satb2gs%7ctranspose%20-kc).


{% include image.html
	file="chor027-c-tonic.png"
	alt="grand-staff layout and transposed to C"
	url="http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor027.krn&filter=satb2gs%7ctranspose%20-kc"
	caption="Chorale transposed to tonic on C using the transpose filter."
	caption-margin-top="-20px"
%}


Change the "c" at the end of the URL for C-transposed chorales to change to another tonic:


D
: [http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor027.krn&filter=satb2gs%7ctranspose%20-kd](http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor027.krn&filter=satb2gs%7ctranspose%20-kd)

E-flat
: [http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor027.krn&filter=satb2gs%7ctranspose%20-ke-](http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor027.krn&filter=satb2gs%7ctranspose%20-ke-)

F-sharp
: [http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor027.krn&filter=satb2gs%7ctranspose%20-kf%23](http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor027.krn&filter=satb2gs%7ctranspose%20-kf%23)

Humdrum data shown in the text editor is untransposed (showing the pre-filtered
data).  In the following screen shot, notice the music is in F major, but the
notation is in F-sharp major:

{% include image.html
	file="chor027-f-sharp.png"
	alt="chorale 27 in f-sharp major"
	caption="Chorale 27 transposed to F-sharp major using the transpose filter."
%}


To view the transposed score in the text editor, type
<span class="keypress">alt-c</span> to compile the filter instructions:

{% include image.html
	file="chor027-f-sharp2.png"
	alt="chorale 27 in f-sharp major"
	caption="Chorale 27 data compiled to F-sharp major with <span class='keypress'>alt-c</span>."
%}


## Downloading and corrections ##

This digital edition of the J.S. Bach chorales is [available on Github](https://github.com/craigsapp/bach-371-chorales) for download.  Corrections to the edition can
be submitted on Github, either as an [issue](https://github.com/craigsapp/bach-371-chorales/issues) (in prose), or preferrably as a [pull request](https://github.com/craigsapp/bach-371-chorales/pulls) (direct corrections to the data files).  The corrections should match the source edition scans (viewed by typing
<span class='keypress'>alt-p</span> on the first 50 chorales, or an explanation
should otherwise be submitted with the correction as to why the correction
does not match the source scans.


## Bach chorale website ##

{% include image.html
	file="chorales-website.jpg"
	alt="J.S. Bach chorale website"
	caption="Website using the Bach chorale digital scores"
%}

<a target="_blank" href="https://chorales.sapp.org">This
website</a> demonstrates how to publish scores on the
web after they are edited with Verovio Humdrum Viewer.
Source code for the website can be viewed <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/craigsapp/bach-370-chorales/tree/gh-pages">here</a>.
The chorale website utilizes the <a target="_blank"
href="https://plugin.humdrum.org">Humdrum notation plugin</a>
to render notation for the chorales dynamically on the website
in a manner similar to VHV.  Also check out the <a target="_blank"
href="https://chorales.sapp.org/typesetter">Typesetter</a> page where you
can adjust the layout for the choral (controlling the size, spacing,
parts, measure range and transposition), and then either copy plugin code
to insert the dynamic notation of a score on your webpage, or download an
SVG to display on your webpage or insert into a paper edited in Microsoft
Word, for example.

{% include image.html
	file="chor273-mm6-7.svg"
	alt="Measures 6&ndash;7 of chorale no. 273"
	caption="Measures 6&ndash;7 of chorale no. 273 generated on the typesetter page."
%}


The above SVG image can also be generated dynamcally in a webpage
using the following code:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>My Example</title>
<script src="https://verovio-script.humdrum.org/scripts/verovio-toolkit.js"></script>
<script src="https://plugin.humdrum.org/scripts/humdrum-notation-plugin.js"></script>
<script>var vrvToolkit = new verovio.toolkit()</script>
</head>
<body>
<div style="width:590px">

<script>displayHumdrum({
   source: "chor273-mm6-7",
   scale: 60,
   spacingNonLinear: 0.58,
   filter: "myank -m 6-7 | satb2gs",
   uri: "github://craigsapp/bach-370-chorales/kern/chor273.krn"
})</script>
<script id="chor273-mm6-7" type="text/x-humdrum"></script>

</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Try copy-and-pasting the above HTML code into a file and open it in a 
web browser to view the same notation as in the figure further above.
