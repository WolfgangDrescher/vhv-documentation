## Opening and closing the help menu ##

A brief list of commands and other resources can be displayed within
the [VHV interface](http://verovio.humdrum.org) by clicking on the
<span class="question">?</span> icon at the top of the page, or by
pressing the <kbd>?</kbd> key.  If you are currently editing text
in the text editor, instead use <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> to avoid
typing a question mark in the editor.

After clicking on the help icon, the help menu appears:

{% include image.html
	file="helpmenu.png"
	alt="VHV main page showing help menu"
	caption="Verovio Humdrum Viewer with the help menu displayed"
%}

The help menu is longer than the height of the window, but you can
scroll through it to see all of its contents:


{% include image.html
	file="helpmenu-scroll.gif"
	alt="Scrolling through the help menu"
	caption="Scrolling through the help menu"
%}


Pressing the <span class="question">?</span> icon at the top of the
page again, or typing <kbd>?</kbd> will hide the help menu.  If the
browser page is wide, you can keep the help menu open for quick
reference while you using the interface.

## Tandem display of VHV documentation ##

At the top of the help menu is a link to this documentation website.
If you want to have quick reference to the documentation while you
are using VHV.  This will open the documentation in another tab.
You can move this tab to its own window and resize according to the
available space on your desktop.

{% include image.html
	file="tandem-documentation.gif"
	max-width="100%"
	alt="opening up a documentation window."
	caption="Opening up a documentation window from the link to it in the help menu."
%}

Help menu entries highlighted in red are hyperlinked into the
documentation and will open up in documentation window as shown
above, where the <span class="keypress">alt-f</span> documentation
is loaded from the help menu.
