[VHV](http://verovio.humdrum.org) is organized into two main components: a 
text editor on the left and a music-notation editor on the right:


{% include image.html

	url="http://verovio.humdrum.org"
	alt="VHV main page"
	caption="Text editor on the left and notation editor on the right"
	margin-bottom="-20px"
%}

Humdrum data typed into the text editor converts
dynamically into music notation:


{% include image.html
	file="twinkle.gif"
	alt="Entering data into the text editor"
	caption="Notation is generated as Humdrum data is typed into the text editor."
%}

See the [Humdrum encoding tutorial](/humdrum/getting_started/) for
instructions on how to type musical data directly in the text editor.  Musical 
data can also be loaded by drag-and-drop of Humdrum, MusicXML or MEI 
files onto the webpage.  MusicXML and MEI files will be converted
automatically into Humdrum data in the text editor.  To edit MusicXML or
MEI files without conversion into Humdrum data first, then copy-and-paste
the data rather than drag-and-drop of the file.  See documentation for
[MusicXML import](/interface/musicxml/) and [MEI import](/interface/mei/)
for more information.

The current note being edited in the text editor is highlighted
in red in the notation view.  Don't forget to end a spine with data
termination token `*-`; otherwise, the Humdrum file will not be
valid, although the VHV interface adds one automatically so that you
can see the music while entering data.

You can click and drag the divider between the text and notation regions
as demonstrated in the following animation.  There is also a keyboard shortcut 
for hiding/showing the text editor by typing <span class="keypress">alt-y</span>.

%}


See the [getting started index page](/tag_getting_started.html) and
in particular a description of the [help menu](/interface/help_menu)
for more basic information about VHV.  Also see the [Humdurm load/save
page](/interface/humdrum) for more ways of loading Humdrum data
into VHV other than typing it in by hand.  See the [introduction to
humdrum](/humdrum/getting_started) page for a tutorial on how to encode
music in the Humdrum syntax, although most often data import is done
via drag-and-drop of [MusicXML](/interface/musicxml) files.
